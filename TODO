TODO:

- After onEqual button, store saved result such that user can directly start new expression with an operator such that we would 
  get "ANS" (operation) number etc..
- Welcolme screen. Cool Caculator name entry screen for a few seconds, before switching to arithmetic screen.
- Better art work on UI?
